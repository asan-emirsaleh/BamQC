# This file provides a mechanism through which certain feature subtypes (biotypes)
# can be merged together or discarded.  It is a 2 column list where the first column
# is the observed biotype which would be read from a GTF file, and the second is 
# the effective biotype which is to be used.
#
# The effective biotype can be any text string.  Blank stings are OK.  If you want
# the biotype to be ignored during parsing then use the keyword DELETE as the effective
# biotype
