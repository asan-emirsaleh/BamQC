RELEASE NOTES FOR BamQC v0.1
----------------------------

FastQC v0.1 is a beta release it should work in its present state but
we are keen to get feedback on the program.  In particular we are
interested to hear if anyone has:

1) Suggestions for other checks we could be performing.

2) Comments about the criteria we set for issuing warnings or errors and
suggestions for how these could be improved.

You can report feedback either though our bug reporting tool at:
