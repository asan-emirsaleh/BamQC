<h1>Common Problems</h1>
<p>
There are a few common problems which can arise when running BamQC.  Below are the
most common things you are likely to see along with a work-round to get you going again.
</p>

<h2>BamQC fails to start</h2>

<p>
SeqMonk is a java application. This means that in order to run BamQC you need to have installed 
a java runtime environment (JRE). If you do not have a JRE installed then BamQC will not start.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of free available JREs. BamQC has been tested to work with Sun JRE v1.6+
running under Windows, Linux and MacOSX. If you don't have this JRE already you can get it from 
https://www.java.com/en/download/. Other java environments/versions may also work, but we 
haven't tested them.
</p>

<h2>BamQC runs slowly or dies whilst loading data</h2>

<p>
The nature of the data BamQC has to deal with is that it is very large. Both genome annotations and 
sequence data take up huge amounts of memory. BamQC requires at least 1GB of RAM for small experiments,
and large experiments may require more. 
</p>

<h2>BamQC won't download new genomes</h2>

<p>
If BamQC fails to import new genomes it's probably because it was unable to contact the web server 
which provides this data. In order to do this your machine needs to be able to access the internet.
</p>
<p>
If your machine is networked and genome importing still doesn't work then the most common cause is 
the proxy server settings (under Network from Edit -> Preferences). If your network uses a proxy server 
you should enter its details here. If not then the proxy server name should be left blank.
