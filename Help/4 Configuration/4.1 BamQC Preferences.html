<h1>BamQC Preferences</h1>
<p>
If you are unsure about changing a preference then it's probably best to leave it
alone.
</p>
<p>
All of your preferences are stored in a file called bamqc_prefs.txt.  This will
be present in your 'home' directory.  On unix based filesystems this will be the
top level of your personal workspace.  On windows it will normally be under
Documents and Settings/[your username].  If you want to completely reset your 
preferences you can simply delete this file and a default file will be created the
next time BamQC is run.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 groups of preference settings which can be accessed via the tabs at
the top of the window.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Files - allows you to set the default location where BamQC will look for
different types of files</li>
<li>Network - allows you to enter settings which may be required to access the internet
from your machine</li>
</ol>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
There are two file locations which can be set.  To change these just press the browse
button on the right of each field and select the directory you want.
</p>
<p>
The file locations you can specify are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Genome Base Location - This is the directory under which your genome files will be stored.
These are automatically downloaded from the SeqMonk server.  By default this folder is 
inside the BamQC installation.  This folder needs to be writable by users of the program.
It can also contain a large amount of data.  You may wish to change this to a local drive, or
have the same genome folder shared by several users to save on disk space.</li>
<li>Default Save Location - This is the folder containing only the genomes at the moment but might 
contain other data used by BamQC in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although you can set default locations here BamQC will also remember the last folder you
used in the current session and use that again once you have changed from the default in
a given session.  The preferred directory will be remembered for the next time you open the
program.
</p>

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>
Depending on the setup of your network you may not be able to access the internet 
directly, but must instead route your connection via a proxy server.  Since BamQC 
requires access to the network to be able to download genome annotation files it
needs to know if your network requires a proxy.
</p>
<p>
If your network uses a proxy you need to fill in the HTTP proxy server and 
HTTP proxy port boxes.  The name of the server should be provided without an http://
prefix (ie wwwcache.example.com rather than http://wwwcache.example.com). If you don't
use a proxy then the server box should be empty (it doesn't matter what is in the 
port box in this case).
</p>
<p>
The final option is to specify a location for the SeqMonk data server.  Although it
is possible for sites to run their own data servers this is not likely to be common
and you should leave this alone unless you are absolutely sure that you need to change
it.
