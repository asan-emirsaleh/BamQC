If you can see the genome you want you can simply select it and press OK.  If it
is not present then you can import it from the SeqMonk genome server.
</p>
<h2>Importing a New Genome</h2>
<p>
There are a large collection of genomes available on the SeqMonk genome server.  To 
import one of these onto your machine press the &quot;Import New&quot; button on
the genome selector.  A second selector should open up displaying the genomes available
on the server.

To import the genome simply select it and press download.  The genome will be installed
onto your system. You will see the download progress on the right side of the status bar. 
You will then need to reselect File -&gt New Project to start creating your project using 
your newly imported genome.
