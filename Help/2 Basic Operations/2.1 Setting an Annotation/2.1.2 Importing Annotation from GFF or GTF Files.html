<h1>Importing GFF or GTF Annotation Files</h1>
<p>
GFF and its relative GTF are simple text formats designed to
describe annotation features.  Older versions of GFF were able
to describe only single locus features, but newer versions
are able to link together multiple entries to create split
location features.
</p>
<p>
BamQC is able to import annotation tracks from all variants
of GFF or GTF files. To load an annotation file: 
select File -&gt; Set GFF/GTF Annotation File
