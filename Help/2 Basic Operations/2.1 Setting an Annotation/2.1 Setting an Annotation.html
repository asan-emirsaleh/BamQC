<h1>Setting an Annotation (optional)</h1>
<p>
An annotation can be used to enrich the analysis for the SAM/BAM 
files with features.
To set an annotation simply run the program and select File -&gt; 
Set Annotation from Network or Set GFF/GTF Annotation File. 
If a selected annotation is no longer needed, it can be unset by 
selecting File -&gt; Unset Annotation.
 </p>
 <p>
 BamQC can load two types of annotations: 
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="2.1.1%20Selecting a Genome.html">Genomes (annotations provided via network)</a></li>
 <li><a href="2.1.2%20Importing Annotation from GFF or GTF Files.html">GFF/GTF files*</a></li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 By default BamQC will try to guess the file format from the name
 of the annotation file.  Anything ending in .gff, .gff3 or .gtf will be 
 opened as an annotation file.
 </p>
 
 <p>
The name for the selected annotation file or genome will be reported on the left side 
of the status bar. Once you have selected your annotation file or genome, you can move on to
<a href="../2.2%20Opening a Sequence File.html">Opening a Sequence File</a>.
