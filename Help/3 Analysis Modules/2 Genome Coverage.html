<h1>Genome Coverage</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The Genome Coverage module shows how the chromosomes are covered within the file. 
If the number of chromosomes is below 50, a coverage per chromosome is shown 
separately. Otherwise, the coverages are shown sequentially. The chromosome 
coverages are shown in red and represent z-scores, where the grey horizontal line 
is the mean value. Regions without coverage (e.g. centromeres) are indicated with 
a black horizontal line located just below the coverage lines. If no coverage 
is reported for a chromosome, it means that that chromosome is not covered 
within the Sam/Bam file. This module is shown if there is at least one 
chromosome is covered.

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
This module raises a warning if more than 5% of the genome is uncovered.
</p>

<h2>Failure</h2>
<p>
This module raises an error if more than 10% of the genome is uncovered.
</p>

<h2>Common reasons for warnings</h2>
<p>
This module raises warnings or errors if a part of the genome is uncovered by the sequences.
